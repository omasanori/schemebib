    Inspired by Actors, we have implemented an interpreter for a Lisp-like
    language, Scheme, based on the lambda calculus, but extended for side
    effects, multiprocessing, and process synchronization. The purpose of
    this implementation is tutorial. We wish to:

    (1) alleviate the confusion caused by Micro-Planner, Conniver, etc. by
    clarifying the embedding of non-recursive control structures in a
    recursive host language like Lisp.
    (2) explaint how to use these control structures, independent of such
    issues as pattern matching and data base manipulation.
    (3) have a simple concrete experimental domain for certain issues of
    programming semantics and style.

    This paper is organized into sections. The first section is a short
    "reference manual" containing specifications for all the unusual
    features of Scheme. Next, we present a sequence of programming examples
    which illustrate various programming styles, and how to use them. This
    will raise certain issues of semantics which we will try to clarify with
    lambda calculus in the third section. In the fourth section we will give a
    general discussion of the issues facing an implementor of an interpreter
    for a language based on lambda calculus. Finally, we will present a
    completely annotated interpreter for Scheme, written in MacLisp, to
    acquaint programmers with the tricks of the trade of implementing
    non-recursive control structures in a recursive language like Lisp.

  abstract: |
    Scheme is a dialect of Lisp. It is an expression-oriented, applicative
    order, interpreter-based language which allows one to manipulate programs
    as data. It differs from most current dialects of Lisp in that it closes
    all lambda-expressions in the environment of their definition or
    declaration, rather than in the execution environment. This has the
    consequence that variables are normally lexically scoped, as in Algol.
    However, in contrast with Algol, Scheme treats procedures as a first-class
    data type. They can be the values of variables, the returned values of
    procedures, and components of data structures. Another difference from Lisp
    is that Scheme is implemented in such a way that tail-recursions execute
    without net growth of the interpreter stack. The effect of this is that a
    procedure call behaves like a goto, and thus procedure calls can be used to
    implement iterations, as in Plasma.

    Here we give a complete "user manual" for the Scheme language. Some
    features described here were not documented in the original report on
    Scheme (for instance particular macros). Other features have been added,
    changed, or deleted as our understanding of certain language issues
    evolved. Annotations to the manual describe the motivations for these
    changes.
